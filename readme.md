## Overview

The objective of Project 2 was to build a fully-functional, full-stack server application using Node/Express and MongoDB/Mongoose. I chose to create an app centered around one of my passions - dogs - which would provide users with an encyclopedic directory of dog breeds, along with user reviews and adoption listings for each breed.
